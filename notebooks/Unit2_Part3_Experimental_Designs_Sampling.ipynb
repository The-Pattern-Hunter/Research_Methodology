    "Example with 15 fish, 3 temperatures:\n",
    "- Use random number generator\n",
    "- Don't choose by size, health, or convenience\n",
    "- Equalizes unknown variables across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reduction (of error)\n",
    "**Minimize unwanted variability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "- Standardize procedures (same time, equipment, person)\n",
    "- Control extraneous variables (age, size, conditions)\n",
