    "You're walking near an industrial area in Western Odisha and notice:\n",
    "- Earthworms are abundant in the soil\n",
    "- They look slightly different from those in agricultural fields\n",
    "- The soil has a metallic smell\n",
    "- Local farmers say \"these worms don't die even in bad soil\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",

    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Systematic**\n",
    "   - Follows a planned, organized approach\n",
    "   - Not random or haphazard\n",
    "   - Example: Collecting earthworms using standardized quadrat sampling, not just picking them randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical**\n",
    "   - Questions assumptions\n",
    "   - Evaluates evidence carefully\n",
    "   - Example: Don't assume earthworms are the same species just because they look similar\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Empirical**\n",
    "   - Based on observation and experimentation\n",
    "   - Verifiable by others\n",
    "   - Example: Measure actual heavy metal concentrations, don't just guess\n",

    "#### 2. **To Verify Existing Knowledge**\n",
    "- Test whether accepted facts are actually true\n",
    "- Example: Confirming that Labeo rohita (Rohu fish) grows faster in warmer water\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **To Understand Phenomena**\n",
    "- Explain how and why things happen\n",
    "- Example: Understanding why certain fish species migrate during monsoon season\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **To Solve Practical Problems**\n",
    "- Apply knowledge to real-world issues\n",
    "- Example: Reducing fish mortality in village ponds due to oxygen depletion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **To Develop Theories and Models**\n",
    "- Create frameworks for understanding\n",
    "- Example: Developing a model for heavy metal bioaccumulation in earthworms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **To Predict Future Events**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Field sampling:** Quadrat sampling (0.5m × 0.5m, n=30 per site)\n",
    "2. **Species identification:** DNA barcoding (COI gene sequencing)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Why quadrats?**\n",

    "   - Morphological identification alone is insufficient for earthworms\n",

    "   - Allows comparison with global databases\n",

    "3. **Why Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)?**\n",
    "   - Most accurate method for metal quantification in biological samples\n",
    "   - Detects ppb-level concentrations\n",
    "   - Standard method in environmental monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why Mann-Whitney U test?**\n",
    "   - Data not normally distributed (tested with Shapiro-Wilk)\n",
